Remember the time when OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022? It quickly became an internet sensation. It became so popular that it gained a million users in 5 days and is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in 2 months.

[ChatGPT disrupted every industry you can think of](https://thedeveloperstory.com/2023/01/27/how-artificial-intelligence-will-change-the-software-development-industry-in-2023/ "ChatGPT disrupted every industry you can think of"), in some shape or form. Several start-ups and organizations, such as Microsoft, massively benefited from it, while [others incurred losses due to the type of business](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/chegg-drops-more-than-40percent-after-saying-chatgpt-is-killing-its-business.html) they were in.

However, [Google was taking the heat head-on, as it was fighting a double war against ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/) (which again is powered by the former language model). The search ad business was in danger.

Well, guess what? 

On May 10, 2023, Google made its AI chatbot, Bard, available in over 180 countries _for free_. And man, oh man, it is a lot better in some aspects when compared to ChatGPT. 

Let’s explore the key differences and find out how Bard can edge out the AI sensation ChatGPT in some aspects.

#### Bard **is designed for conversations**

Bard is a language model for dialogue applications ([LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/)), which is said to be trained on Infiniset to have more natural and open-ended conversations with humans. ChatGPT, on the other hand, is based on GPT models trained on an enormous text dataset gathered from the internet.

What makes LaMDA different from GPT is that it has the capability to comprehend the user’s prompt’s intent and context nuances. When you are having a full-blown conversation with Bard, with several threads of information already shared, it still remembers the previous chats and helps you with the appropriate answers.

#### Bard connects with the Internet

ChatGPT does not provide access to the internet by default. Google Bard, on the other hand, includes an Internet connection, giving it an advantage over its OpenAI counterpart. I mean, this feature alone would make a massive difference when it comes to getting the latest news.

Bard is trained using a vast dataset of text and code, as well as data from the internet. This enables the chatbot to provide thorough and useful responses to questions. It can provide you with the most recent news as well as information from the Internet.

#### Bard can generate Images as Responses

Bard is capable of providing images in its text response. In the Google I/O 2023 event, Google showed this capability when you ask anything.

This capability will surely enhance the search as we know it. Currently, the feature is not yet available because Bard is still in its experimental phase as of this writing. 

ChatGPT, on the other hand, is efficient at generating comprehensive text responses; however, it falls short when it comes to delivering images in response.

#### Bard is free (as of now)

Initially, ChatGPT was introduced with all its features available at no cost. However, as its user base grew significantly, OpenAI made the decision to introduce a subscription fee of $20 per month for accessing its latest language model, GPT-4. The chatbot functionality of the GPT-3.5 model, however, is still free.

Bard is free and is open to 180+ countries. They might keep it free for a while until it adds more features, while taking feedback from its users.

#### **Bard has a better user experience**

When you try Bard, almost instantly you will feel the experience incredibly buttery smooth, whereas the user interface of ChatGPT is plain and simple. I mean, I don’t blame OpenAI since their purpose is to provide better AI responses with their GPT models, whereas since Google is late to the party, they have to fight with all their guns blazing.

#### Bard’s coding abilities is damn impressive

For me, this is the most exciting feature that was announced in the I/O event about Bard: that it supports over 20 programming languages. This includes C++, Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and many more. It is designed to help professionals with code generation, explanation, and debugging.

In addition to its support for a wide range of programming languages, Bard is also trained on a massive dataset of text and code, thereby allowing it to generate code that is both accurate and efficient. It can also explain the code it generates (_just like ChatGPT_), which can be helpful for debugging and learning new programming languages. ChatGPT has already surpassed a lot of expectations with its ability to generate code.

When Bard, unlike ChatGPT, uses code from the web, it will always cite the source so that you can learn more about it. This helps to ensure that you are using accurate and up-to-date information, and it also gives credit to the original creators of the code.

#### Final Thoughts

Bard is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we get information, create things, write articles, or even code. It also allows the users to export the response to Google Docs or Gmail.

ChatGPT is owned by OpenAI, which has been funded by several investors, such as Microsoft and even Elon Musk. Bard is Google’s own brainchild to tackle the threat that ChatGPT is posing to its search ad business.

Although there’s a long way to go for Bard, it can definitely fight the big war against ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing.
