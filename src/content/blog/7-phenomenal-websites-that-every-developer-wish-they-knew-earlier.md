A few months back, I [published an article](https://thedeveloperstory.com/2022/04/04/9-incredible-websites-that-every-developer-should-bookmark/) that garnered lots of positive feedback because it was helpful and useful to several readers (mostly developers). I realized that what I shared is just a fraction of the plethora of useful websites that are available today.

Hence, for the past two months, I have compiled another list of _phenomenal_ websites. These websites are not only useful but provide incredible value in terms of work, while some make the job efficient at the same time.

_Website link:_ [**https://compressor.io/**](https://compressor.io/)

Beginning with one of my favorite websites in the recent weeks. This website is one which I would recommend everyone to use. Why? Let me explain. This website is one of the intelligent image compressors that reduces the size of your image without even impacting your image dimensions.

I tried uploading an image of _5.42 MB_, and it compressed the image to _331 KB_ without changing the dimensions or quality. You have to try this website to see the magic. I have used a lot of image compressors, but this one stands out.

### BrowserFrame

_Website link:_ [**https://www.remove.bg/**](https://www.remove.bg/)

The website, as the name suggests, removes the background from any image. Yes, there are other web applications available that do the same. For example, Canva can also remove the background from any image, but you need to pay for the premium. This website effectively removes the background of any image without charging you a dime. You can also add new backgrounds to the images as well.
