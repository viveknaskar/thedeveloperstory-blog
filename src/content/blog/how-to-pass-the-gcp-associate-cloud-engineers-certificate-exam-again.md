In this era of artificial intelligence, where some companies have slowed down hiring, having a cloud certification will elevate the credibility of your cloud skills along with your software development skills.

In January 2021, [I took the GCP Associate Cloud Exam for the first time and passed successfully](https://thedeveloperstory.com/2021/01/10/a-developers-guide-for-passing-google-cloud-associate-cloud-engineer-exam/). That preparation and notes really helped me in my work at my workplace.

Since then, I have worked extensively in several Google Cloud services, such as _Dataflow, Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, Scheduler, Cloud Storage, Memorystore_ (Google Cloud’s managed instance for Redis database), and many others.

My certification was going to expire, and hence, I prepared it for two weeks, reviewed all my notes, and [passed the exam — the second time](https://www.credential.net/001db37a-e72a-4584-8c34-726ecef7acc4).

### **About the** Exam

This is a multiple-choice exam with 50 questions in total to be answered in 2 hours. The questions have become longer than the last time I appeared.

The prerequisite is to have familiarity with all the Google Cloud services that would only come if you use the services for a while. Google expects you to know 40+ services for the exam. There’s no negative marking and after completing the exam, you can easily review your answers before submitting.

### Resources I used For The Exam

The first resource, that I would ask everyone to go through to review the topics that is there for the Google Cloud’s Associate Cloud Exam as the syllabus has been getting updated more often.

[_Associate Cloud Engineer Certification exam guide_](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/guides/cloud-engineer)

For reviewing all the topics that would come in the exam, [_Parvez Mulla_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parvez-mulla/)_,_ _now a Google Cloud Architect_, had a created a video (some years back) that would summarize all the topics in the best possible way. I referred to this video the first time and this video is still incredibly useful.

I already had the [Udemy course by Dan Sullivan**,**](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-certified-associate-cloud-engineer-2019-prep-course/) who is the author of the [_Official Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide_](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Professional-Cloud-Architect-Study/dp/1119602440)_._ This course would break down several topics and would list down all the necessary points that you should know about the service. Additionally, Dan also provides some hands-on that would help you remember some services.

But, if you don’t want to buy an Udemy course, there’s also a YouTube course by [Antoni Tzavelas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonit/) on freeCodeCamp’s YouTube channel for free. It is also incredibly concise.

And finally, [the YouTube playlist created by Sathish VJ on how to tackle the GCP ACE’s exam questions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQMsfKRZZviRwqJwNmh1eAWnRMvlrk40x&si=VrIstq9X1TBqJGZH). Every video in this playlist asks a question and also provides a solution with complete explanation.

I also published a blog having concise notes and tips here, and I have used the same for prepping at the last minute.

### Final Thoughts

Before writing the exam, I practised a lot to get familiar with the types of questions that would be asked.

If I had to compare the questions this time around against the last time, the questions would have become longer and more scenario- and situation-based.

_Yes, the exam can be passed if you know about all the services._ However, I still think one should never appear for the cloud exam [without taking the practice tests](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfexWKtXT2OSFJ-obA4iT3GmzgiOCGvjrT9OfxilWC1yPtmfQ/viewform).
