It’s probably presumptuous of me to write about data-driven globalization. I’m not an expert. I have views and opinions but no data to support those, especially when it comes to abstract themes such as this. And yet I dare to write about the relevance of data especially for a world that’s increasingly becoming afflicted and influenced by the same patterns, same worries, same burning issues.

The year 2020 triggered the true start of this phenomenon called ‘**_virtual globalization_**’. Movies stopped releasing in theatres resulted in the rise of other OTT platforms in a market where _Netflix_ and _Amazon Prime Video_ are dominating and they are becoming successful. In the uncertainties kicked off by the pandemic, when everyone wonders if we would ever get back to the world we knew before now. The only certainty is this: ‘**_Data is the king’_** and it will help us cope with the possibilities and impossibilities of 2021 and 2022.

In many economies and nations where they dropped caution in favour of freedom, the cases have started to spiral again due to the new strain of the virus. People who were telling me till recently, “_we can’t put our lives on hold because of this_” and flouted rules and precautions are seeing their countries gripped by the same fears all over again. And this I can say, based on verified data. Hard facts. Numbers. Scientific answers are given by those who know what they are talking about. No assumptions here, only raw data. News is in my bones and so I go by that. **_So, will I put my life on hold, as we see virtual globalization grow?_** _As we wait for the pandemic to reach its peak yet again, as we await the much-needed herd community and vaccine?_

**_No_**. _Life continues with its promise of engaging work, exciting collaborations, inspiring projects and delightful work_**_._** And there’s data in that too! I say this based on the number of people I see who are leading their lives with passion and purpose. And the virus won’t kill their spirit. We all have data to show that we need to remain cautious. But we also have data to show that we can live our lives.
