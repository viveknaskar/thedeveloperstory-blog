When I was in college, we were asked to learn and practise the programming language C, and then were asked to choose any other high-level programming language such as C++ or Java. However, things are changing. Nowadays, aspiring developers are finding JavaScript the most fascinating programming language to learn. You see, JS was not very popular back then, although the language was created back in 1995.

Since the release of _Node.JS_, the open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment, JavaScript code can now be executed outside a web browser. This is the sole reason JavaScript is known as the language of the Web, due to its “_JavaScript everywhere_” paradigm, which integrates everything in web application development around a single programming language, instead of having a separate language for server-side and client-side scripts.

With so many platforms and options available, learning programming has never been easier. YouTube is one such platform, and the best part is that it is completely free. There are various channels with JavaScript and its frameworks’ tutorials or other content where the creators make programming absolutely fun to learn.

Hence, I am sharing some of the best YouTube channels, in no particular order, that you must definitely check out and take away as much as possible.

### Traversy Media

_Subscribers:_ **_1.7M_**

There should not be any lists where the channel, Traversy Media, is not there. Started by _Brad Traversy_ back in 2009, the channel has some of the most fulfilling JavaScript and its frameworks, such as _Vue, Angular, Node.js,_ and popular libraries such as _jQuery, React, Chart.js_, etc. Apart from that, he creates full-featured crash courses on other different programming languages, frameworks, tools, and libraries.

The channel also includes videos from Brad and other notable guest instructors, such as “_Build Hangman With React_,” “_Build a Music Player | Vanilla JavaScript_,” “_JavaScript BookList App | No Frameworks_,” “_7 Tips to Ace Job Interviews_,” and hundreds of more educational tutorials. The channel has influenced several other programming channels and inspired many aspiring individuals to take web development.

### Ben Awad

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/BenAwad97_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenAwad97)  
_Subscribers:_ **_359K_**

Ben is a software developer who creates videos and uploads them on his channel about _React, React Native, GraphQL, Typescript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Python_, and other videos where he shares his experiences. He is extremely experienced in React and has uploaded numerous projects developed with React on his channel.

Ben is incredibly witty and sarcastic in his videos, and his hate for Angular and his love for React is loved by his subscribers. He also has some unique videos on his hate for Angular. His videos, “_I Love Angular.js_” and “_Google Knows Best_”, are hilarious and sarcastic.

### Dev Ed

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/DevEd_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevEd)  
_Subscribers:_ **_708K_**

The channel, _Dev Ed,_ was started in just 2018 and has seen exponential growth due to the quality of videos that were being uploaded. The channel has videos on _Vanilla JavaScript, React, UI & UX,_ and _Node.js_. The channel also has other discussion-based videos where he discusses his experiences. What makes his videos stand out is his unique sense of humour and honest explanations, which is incredible to watch.

### Web Dev Simplified

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified)  
_Subscribers:_ **_723K_**

_Web Dev Simplified_ is another underrated channel that started in 2018. Kyle, a brilliant all-around developer, ensures that anything he teaches is easier to grasp and understand. There are videos on learning web development, a variety of several project ideas, and a plethora of useful tips and advice videos for all aspiring as well as seasoned developers.

### The Net Ninja

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja)  
_Subscribers:_ **_827K_**

One of the best channels for front-end development that features extensive video tutorials on _Modern JavaScript (beginner to advanced), Node.js, React, Vue.js, Firebase, HTML & CSS_, and numerous other topics. The channel has one of the most consistent uploads, with playlists on many courses, making this one of the best channels in programming.

The instructor has a warm and upbeat voice, makes learning enjoyable, and explains everything thoroughly. He even has many courses on Udemy, although his free videos on YouTube are of high quality and better (_in my opinion_).

### Fireship

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship)  
_Subscribers:_ **_924K_**

An incredible channel that focuses on building projects in one video, and also explains things in their simplest form using animations. Started by Jeff Delaney in 2017, the channel has grown by leaps and bounds due to its phenomenal content on Web development.

In most of the videos, Jeff uses the Firebase platform, which was created by Google for app development. However, his wide range of tutorials, including “_10 CSS Pro Tips — Code This, Not That!_” and “_JavaScript Pro Tips — Code This, Not That!_” as well as unique playlists like “_100 Seconds of Code_,” “_Frontend Mini Projects_,” and “_Code This, Not That_,” has earned him enormous popularity in the tech Twitter community. I promise you will be hooked on his channel, and you will learn a lot from him.

### codeSTACKr

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/codeSTACKr_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/codeSTACKr)  
_Subscribers:_ **_165K_**

_CodeSTACKr_ is another underrated channel that needs far more attention than it currently receives. _Jesse Hall_, a Senior Developer Advocate at MongoDB, launched this channel in 2018 as a challenge to show his teenage children that if he works hard and uploads consistently, he can earn subscribers. Fortunately, he did.

The channel has some of the most interesting programming videos on the platform. Jesse creates a monthly (_formerly weekly_) news video series on anything and everything linked to technology. He also invites teachers on a variety of other topics. Since he has worked in the software industry for more than 16 years, his videos are extremely well researched, and you will learn a lot from him.

There is no better platform to learn than YouTube, where you have an opportunity to learn almost anything for free, including web development. Of course, your dedication and hard work have to be on your end, and the most important aspect of learning is consistency.

Like everything in life, this compilation might not be the best and I may have listed some of my favourite channels from whom I have learned immensely. However, the list cannot be complete without an honourable mention of some other incredible channels — [**Derek Banas**](https://www.youtube.com/c/derekbanas), [**Academind**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Academind), [**Programming with Mosh**](https://www.youtube.com/user/programmingwithmosh), [**freeCodeCamp**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp), and [**LevelUpTuts**](https://www.youtube.com/user/LevelUpTuts)**.**

I am hopeful that you will definitely check out these channels that will help you learn and grow in your web development career.
