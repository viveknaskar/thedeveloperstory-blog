But I have learned one lesson in life. _Stop thinking about the past_. The past will give you nothing. When you are down, just keep going. When you fail, just try again. Don’t stop, just keep going. No matter what. You must try and try harder and even if you fail, you must trust the process, not think about the product. When you make a body, don’t think about the final product of it, just don’t lose focus. You must learn to trust the process.
