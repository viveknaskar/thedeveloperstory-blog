I have been working in software development for over 6 years now. I have worked on several technologies for building enterprise applications. However, I have noticed that for developing enterprise applications, Java is still one of the most preferred programming languages for application development.

Java’s arsenal includes powerful capabilities such as excellent performance, robust memory management, and high security. It also boasts one of the world’s most mature developer communities. In fact, as of this writing, [_Java is currently the third most popular tag on StackOverflow, after only JavaScript and Python_](https://stackoverflow.com/tags)_._

One of the best platforms from where you can learn more about Java is YouTube, which has over 2.3 billion users all over the world. The platform has become the largest video search engine in the world and [_ranks 2nd in terms of global internet traffic and engagement as per Alexa_](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youtube.com).

The other day, I shared an article with [_my LinkedIn connections_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viveknaskar/) in a group when someone asked me about the best YouTube channels for Java, which I replied to, but then it also inspired me to write this and share it with others.

Hence, I am sharing some of the best YouTube channels that, in my opinion, every Java developer must follow. Please note that these YouTube channels are in no particular order, but these definitely will help you gain immense ideas and knowledge to excel in the Java ecosystem.

### Java Brains

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaBrainsChannel_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaBrainsChannel)  
_Subscribers:_ **_532k_**

_Koushik Kothagal_, a Staff Engineer at LinkedIn, created this channel where he uploads videos about everything a Java developer needs to know while working in the software industry. The explanations and the reasoning that Koushik makes are so lucid that anyone can easily comprehend them. _Java Brains_ is definitely one of the best YouTube channels for Java, in my opinion.

Koushik also posts a range of interesting videos, like “_Building a Coronavirus tracker app with Spring Boot and Java_,” “_What is OAuth really all about_,” “_5 common LeetCode mistakes with Coding Interview Prep_,” “_What is API gateway really all about_,” and many more.

### in28minutes

_Channel Link:_ [](https://www.youtube.com/c/rithustutorials)**_[**_https://www.youtube.com/user/rithustutorials_**](https://www.youtube.com/user/rithustutorials)_**  
_Subscribers:_ **_127k_**

_Ranga Karanam_ started this channel with the sole intention of teaching people about programming using a problem-solution based step-by-step hands-on approach with practical, real-world application examples. He also has several Udemy courses, but his YouTube channel is equally engaging.

Ranga believes that to learn anything, a developer must be consistent, and hence he named his channel _in28minutes,_ where an aspiring developer must learn, code, and practise for at least 28 minutes every day. He also has a lot of DevOps and Cloud related courses along with several Java and its related frameworks.

### freeCodeCamp

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp)  
_Subscribers:_ **_4.64M_**

Whenever someone asks me about a platform where a programming course can be effectively learned, I frequently recommend [_freeCodeCamp_](https://freecodecamp.org/), a non-profit organisation dedicated to making web development accessible to everyone for free. They also have a channel with amazing playlists, some of them based on Java, and you will definitely learn a lot from them.

Since the channel is open-source, a lot of guest teachers come on the platform to teach for free. The channel also doesn’t have any advertisements, hence I often refer to it as a “_Free Udemy_” alternative.

### thenewboston

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston_**](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston)  
_Subscribers:_ **_2.59M_**

When I started learning about coding way back in 2011, there were not many YouTube channels or resources in general that were teaching coding for free. However, one man, _Bucky Roberts_, started teaching Java with subtle humour and bizarre variable names (_which I absolutely loved_) for free.

If you are a beginner at Java, then you will absolutely love this channel. The channel also has several guest teachers who teach other courses as well. Bucky’s channel, _thenewboston,_ is one of the best programming channels out there.

### **Amigoscode**

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/amigoscode_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/amigoscode)  
_Subscribers:_ **_270K_**

_Amigocodes_ is another incredible channel that started getting huge traction in 2019 due to its unique variety of videos. _Nelson_, a software developer from London, United Kingdom, founded the channel, which includes, among other things, tutorials on Java and Spring Boot.

### Java Techie

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaTechie_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaTechie)  
_Subscribers:_ **_64.1K_**

If you are already working or have started working as a Java developer, then you know that to develop an application, you need to add authentication and authorization, set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment, and create an on-prem or cloud environment for deployment. _Java Techie_ is one such channel that teaches everything that a Java developer in an organisation is expected to know.

Although I know nothing about the creator, I believe he is working from Bengaluru, India. If you check the videos and playlist of the channel, you will be amazed to find unique videos that you wish you knew about earlier. This channel is underrated and I am sure it is a goldmine for any Java developer.

### Telusko

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/Telusko_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Telusko)  
_Subscribers:_ **_1.55M_**

_Naveen Reddy_ is a full-time tech educator and a freelance software developer who is currently based out of Mumbai, India. His channel, _Telusko,_ is one of the most viewed channels on Java due to the variety of Java-based videos it has. His videos are quite engaging and his unique delivery is what attracts followers (whom he calls “_aliens_”) to stay glued to his videos till the very end.

In order to explain a concept, Naveen reduces it to its simplest form with relevant real-life examples. If you want to stay up-to-date with anything related to Java, this channel is the one you might find useful.

I might be repeating myself if I say that YouTube is the best platform where you can learn programming for free. And, honestly, I simply enjoyed working on this compilation since I have been following and suggesting these channels to my fellow peers at my workplace, [_my LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viveknaskar/) _connections_, or even on [_my Instagram page_](https://www.instagram.com/thedeveloperstory/).

The compilation is incomplete without an honourable mention of some other incredible channels—[**Programming with Mosh**](https://www.youtube.com/user/programmingwithmosh), [**Derek Banas**](https://www.youtube.com/c/derekbanas), [**edureka**](https://www.youtube.com/c/edurekaIN)**,** [**Code Decode**](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeDecode), [**Java Guides**](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaGuides), and [**Java**](https://www.youtube.com/user/java) (_the official Java channel_). I hope this compilation might be useful for you and help you grow in your development career.

_Note: The YouTube channels are not in any particular order, and the subscriber count may change by the time you are reading this._
