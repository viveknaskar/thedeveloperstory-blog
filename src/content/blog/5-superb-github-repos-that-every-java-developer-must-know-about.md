Since the last decade, there has been enormous growth with a number of programming languages being created and used in developing projects. However, every language has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For developing enterprise applications, Java is still the most preferred programming language among developers and programmers.

Java has some powerful weapons in its arsenal, including _high performance_, _strong memory management_, and _high security_. It also has one of the most mature developer communities in the world. In fact, as of today, [_Java is the second most popular tag_](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) only after JavaScript on Stack Overflow.

The [tags on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) demonstrate a topic’s popularity, Java is the 2nd popular tag

Personally, I have been programming in Java for over 6 years now and from what I have learned, bigger organizations prefer performance and security in their web applications, which Java is recognized for. It is used to create software for a variety of platforms. It is a statically typed programming language, which allows it to run quicker than other languages such as Python or JavaScript. The language is simple and straightforward to write. The best thing about Java is that it is machine-independent.

With that in mind, I’ve created a list of GitHub repositories that I found quite useful and that would be of great benefit to any developer, whether seasoned or a newbie, in his quest to learn the language.

_Stars:_ **_14.9k  
_**_Forks:_ **_3.6k_**

The release of Java 8 was a game-changer for the language and its developer community. Among other things, it introduced the object-oriented Java language to the world of functional programming. [_These features have significantly increased performance, simplified development processes, and made Java more efficient_.](https://thedeveloperstory.com/2020/10/23/comprehensive-notes-for-java-8-features-every-developer-must-have/) 

This repository provides numerous short and helpful code snippets of functional programming principles presented in a clear and accessible manner. This repository will be extremely useful if you are new to Java functional programming.
