_Gary Vee_, one of the global social media sensations, has pioneered the art of public speaking, built businesses out of nothing, and was an early adopter of NFTs, among several other things, and has indirectly popularised the “Hustle culture” after his best-selling book, “_Crushing It!”_ was launched.

Don’t get me wrong, Gary is freaking inspiring and I love all his videos.

People, however, have perceived his ideas wrong. The hustle culture that we know of today has no limits on hard work; all it strives is to achieve the goal through relentless hard work, no matter how much you feel tired.

Another flamboyant billionaire and celebrity, _Elon Musk_, has been praised and loved by his fans for his incredible work ethic.

In fact, Elon has inspired me a lot at a time when I used to spend my days procrastinating and then feeling guilty about wasting them. [I even wrote a piece on him](https://thedeveloperstory.com/2020/12/13/the-intriguing-routine-life-lessons-from-elon-musk-will-inspire-the-shit-out-of-you/).

Elon has criticised the standard 40-hour-week on Twitter.

> There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week

The romanticism of work and the mindset that you should constantly be working and being productive have negative mental and physical health consequences. The constant cycle of overworking to the extent of burnout has created immense competition and rivalries in schools, colleges and workplaces.

According to Elon, people should work 80–100 hours a week. Since he has millions of followers, I am sure people replicated his work ethic — including his work hours.

The message of working longer and depriving yourself of sleep to achieve your goals faster is totally absurd. It does more harm than good. An increased workload along with the expectation of becoming immediately successful will eventually lead to burnout.

In fact, we didn’t learn anything from Japan’s _karoshi_ culture, which literally means “_overwork death_” in the Japanese language. [In this culture, overworked Japanese middle-aged men would drop dead from bodily failure or opt to commit suicide rather than go back to the office.](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/karoshi-japan-overwork-culture)

The karoshi culture is now spreading across the world. People should realise that working yourself to death should not be the trend.

The most affected people are the millennials and generation Z, who are fascinated by the idea of becoming successful and rich in the shortest amount of time. People from all professions are obsessed with this, and hence, they sacrifice their well-being due to it.

Just open Instagram and you will realize that thousands of Instagram accounts are promoting this hustle and grind culture.

It is extremely important to take care of your physical and mental health. Hustle culture creates unrealistic expectations, fosters an unhealthy lifestyle, and encourages unhealthy competitiveness and burnout. We should be mindful and downplay the trend at any cost.
