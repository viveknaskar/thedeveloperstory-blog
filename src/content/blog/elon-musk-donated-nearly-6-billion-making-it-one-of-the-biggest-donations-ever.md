_Can a billionaire end world hunger?_ _Can a billionaire end world poverty?_ These questions have been asked endlessly and discussed heavily on multiple platforms.

There has been a lot of debate about whether it will have any impact if a billionaire decides to donate a portion of his wealth to eradicate the problem.

On October 30th, 2021, _Dr Eli David_, a researcher, lecturer, and founder, tweeted a screenshot of an article where it stated that 2% of Elon Musk’s wealth could “solve world hunger.”

Musk did respond to the tweet, “_If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it._”

> If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.

Musk also had one condition: whatever he donates must be open source accounting, so the public can see precisely how the money is spent.

This is when David Beasley, the Executive Director for the UN World Food Programme, responded that they are ready with the plan and they will be completely transparent in their spending.

Musk tweeted a poll in November asking his followers if he should sell 20% of his Tesla stock in order to counter accusations of tax evasion. Nearly 58% of the 3.5 million voters said “yes”.

> Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.  
>   
> Do you support this?

Well, in November, Musk made a massive donation of $5.7 billion of Tesla shares, based on average prices on the days he sold the stock to an undisclosed charity. It was obviously speculated that Musk might have donated to the WFP. However, the WFP confirmed that they hadn’t received any amount as of this writing.

Now, here’s the thing: various media outlets and publishers claim that Musk has been among the least charitable billionaires in the world due to the size of his fortune. He has donated hundreds of millions to various charities in the past.

However, a donation of this magnitude with the intention of helping others and solving world problems should undoubtedly inspire others to do the same.
