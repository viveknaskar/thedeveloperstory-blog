You all might remember Yahoo, the search engine giant before Google.

Well, the billion-dollar company was more or less dead, but the company has pivoted under [Apollo Global Management](https://www.apollo.com/) by Verizon and is now seemingly making a comeback.

### The Rich History of Yahoo

Yahoo for sure has had one of the most thrilling and adventurous trajectories with a bad ending, unfortunately.

Many of the apps and services we today take for granted were either invented or immediately adopted by Yahoo.

Broadcast.com, which later became Yahoo TV, existed before YouTube. Flickr existed before Instagram. Yahoo Notebook existed before Evernote. Before Spotify, there was Yahoo Music. And so forth.

From a business viewpoint, Yahoo also pioneered the pay-per-click advertising model, which subsequently became ubiquitous across the internet.

Before Google took over, the company was the Google of the world, and was valued at $125 billion at the peak of the dot-com bubble.

Despite this, a sequence of poor decisions led to the company’s decline, and it was finally sold to Verizon for $4.5 billion, leaving it nothing more than a shadow of its former self.

### The Renaissance of Yahoo

When Verizon could not make anything out of Yahoo, they sold the company to Apollo for $5 billion.

Under Apollo, the company is massively thriving. They acquired the technology news site, [_TechCrunch_](https://techcrunch.com/)_._ Apart from that, they also acquired multiple companies and invested in a couple of them.

The company reportedly raked in $8 billion with substantial revenue margins. Its legacy businesses, such as AOL, still generate millions of dollars in cash flow every year.

Yahoo has been subjected to constant memes on the internet, but it still prints money. Whether it can come back and replace Google to become the top search engine like it was before, it is highly unlikely.

We will have to wait and see what the future holds for Yahoo.
