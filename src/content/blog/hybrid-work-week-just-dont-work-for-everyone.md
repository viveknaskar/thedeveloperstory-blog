I am probably one of the very few people who are disappointed with the hybrid model of work, where you need to work 2 days at an office and 3 days remotely.

But, just hear me out.

The ever-evolving post-lockdown situation for most software companies has been really confusing. Even for us, the dates for returning to the office have always been under discussion, where the decision would change whenever there was any positive case due to the virus.

However, I finally got an email from the office last month, stating that going forward, the hybrid working model would be implemented, where the senior folks would need to work from the office for 2 days.

Several organizations have their own back-to-office plans, but my organization required us to be present in May or possibly June. Several organizations said that the junior folks or even the new joiners need to have office experience and know the work culture along with the organization‚Äôs principles.

Now, why I am against this hybrid model because I have to go back to the city where my organization is situated. Currently, I am living with my family where I don‚Äôt have to cook, do laundry, or do several other unimportant yet mandatory chores. However, that will change when I go back to the other city.

Additionally, when I go back, the rent and other expenses will increase, and I believe the rent will be higher this time. I also have to do all the mundane things before I go and after I come back from the office.

Also, the work from the home situation has really suited me well. I mean, I started writing during the lockdown, learnt new skills and even read dozens of books, which otherwise would not have been possible.

I am sure a lot of people want to go back to the office, as for some the motivation is lost, creativity is gone, and their work has become monotonous. But if you ask me, I have become more productive in my work, and I am able to do several things.

And, in any case, two days at the office followed by three days at home would not work for me because I have to travel to another city where I will be alone and not with my family.

I never thought it was possible to work from home or even get a work from home option for my project, since I am working on a critical financial application for a US-based client. _That was a myth!_ My team delivered some of the toughest requirements from the clients within record time and got appreciation from the client.

Even the CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky, challenged the necessity of in-person work itself. In fact, he recently announced that [his employees can work from anywhere ‚Äî without taking a pay cut](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-adopts-work-from-anywhere-approach-including-overseas-11651192240)_._ In an [interview with Time](https://time.com/6174653/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-interview/), he said, ‚Äú_I think that the office, as we know it, is over._‚Äù He even predicted that most companies would shift to only requiring employees to meet up once per quarter in the future.

Hence, it should be _mandatory_ to work from home, and organizations should not enforce this on their employees.

If there were hybrid work months when all the employees would work from their office for some months and from their homes for others, I would be down for that. However, the hybrid work week doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

I am sure most of you reading this would definitely disagree with my reasoning. But this is my situation. I will have to go to the office five days a week.

Would I have said the same if I lived in the same city where my organization is located? _Hell no!_ I would have been really happy, actually.

What is your opinion on this? I am really curious to know from you all.

P.S. My organization doesn‚Äôt provide free food or laundry service, unlike some companies. I hope you found that out from above. üòä
