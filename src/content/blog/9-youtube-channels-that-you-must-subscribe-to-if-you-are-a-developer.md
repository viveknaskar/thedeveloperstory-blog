As of 2020, YouTube has over 2.3 billion users across the world. The numbers are just increasing every year. It is ranked [_2nd in global internet engagement, as per stats from Alexa_](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youtube.com). Since the platform is free, it invites creators around the world to create content on _travel, news, vlogs, finance, music, education, body-building_ and other different niches.

One of the most popular niches on the platform is programming or technology. _Why?_ Programming or coding is one of the few jobs that anyone can learn from anywhere at any age and get a job. I have seen people change their professions from _medical professionals, lawyers, former military professionals_, etc. to successful software developers.

[According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6), between 2016 and 2026, the number of software developers is expected to grow at a rate of 24%, much faster than any other occupation in the country. This is just an estimate, the numbers will grow more with newer uncharted technologies coming up every day.

Many aspiring developers and programmers use their best coding YouTube channels to learn and grow their programming abilities. These channels not only provide coding tips but also essential job-seeking recommendations, such as assistance in developing a beautiful resume and preparing for interviews.

There are hundreds of such programming channels on YouTube from where you can learn and upskill yourself. However, I am sharing some of the best YouTube channels, in no particular order, that I believe every software developer must subscribe to.

Kalle Hallden is a software developer who loves exploring various technologies and makes proof-of-concept videos. He has made tonnes of videos using Python automation and all his videos are liked and shared across multiple platforms. He currently works from home in Sweden. His videos are extremely high quality and would make the top YouTubers jealous.

The best thing about Kalle is that he is a self-taught developer who not only does an impressive number of projects but also explains how and what he does to complete them.

### Joma Tech

The channel also shares Joma’s interview experiences with various companies, including the _FAANG_ companies. _FAANG_ is an acronym given to the five best performing American tech companies, i.e., Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. Another popular acronym is FAAMG, where M stands for Microsoft. Joma is one of the first YouTubers who popularized these acronyms.

### freeCodeCamp

The NGO consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications, local organizations and a YouTube channel. 

If you are a beginner, chances are you might have already heard about their incredible YouTube channel. The channel doesn’t have any advertisements. The best part is that it is open-source, hence any profound developer can contribute to the channel’s playlist. They have full-length courses on various technologies and programming languages such as _JavaScript, Java, Python, Full-ethical Hacking, Data Science_, and even _Machine Learning_.

More and more courses are coming onto the platform that can be availed for free. Whenever someone asks me about a programming course, I recommend this channel to them without having second thoughts.

_Subscribers:_ **_2.58M_**

This channel is the OG, the oracle from where it all started. Learning programming became popular and free on YouTube because someone decided to upload videos regularly so that people around the world could learn to code. That someone is Bucky Roberts. Bucky started the channel back in February 2008, even before the popular tech channel, [_Marques Brownlee (MKBHD)_](https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd).

Learning programming from books was extremely difficult for me and others, but the videos created by Bucky are so popular that they inspired a generation to start their own programming channels. The channel has tutorials on J_ava, Python, C++, Blockchain, Angular, React, Docker, Django_ and other popular languages and frameworks. It was over 4000+ videos.

Bucky recently created an open-source _thenewboston_ Blockchain and is currently uploading videos to it. Hence, if you want to learn about Blockchain technology, then you must check the videos out.

### TechWorld with Nana

_Channel Link:_ [**_https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWorldwithNana_**](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWorldwithNana)  
_Subscribers:_ **_348k_**

Probably the newest channel on the list, Nana Janashia started this channel in 2019 and she has garnered 345k subscribers in 2 years. This is due to the fact that she uploads tutorials on trending DevOps technologies for free. So far, she has tutorials for _Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Prometheus Monitoring, Terraform, YAML,_ and other tools. Nana is a _Docker Captain_, _AWS Container Hero_ & _CNCF Ambassador_.

If you are a software developer for some time, then you know that these DevOps technologies are hot in the IT market. Their tutorials are expensive if you check out Udemy or other platforms. However, Nana has made these tutorials extremely professional and easy to understand with a completely hands-on approach. If you want to excel in your career in DevOps, then this channel is a gold mine for you.

### Traversy Media

### Java Brains

Undoubtedly, one of the best channels on YouTube for Java and its frameworks.

His explanations of concepts are top-notch and he is often referred to as one of the best Java tutors on the platform by several viewers.
