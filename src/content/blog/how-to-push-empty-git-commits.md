Sometimes, there might be instances when you have integrated your builds and you need to trigger a build without any changes in your code. Also, you need to trigger a build manually.

The only way to trigger the build is through Git. You may trigger your build without making any modifications to the project by pushing a ‚Äúempty commit.‚Äù

### So, How to Do that?

Git doesn‚Äôt allow commits without the commit messages. To push a new commit to the remote repository, you need to make changes to the project you are working on.

You can use the below command to do that:

```
**git commit --allow-empty -m "Test commit"**
```

Now, simply pushing the commit the changes to the remote using the below commit.

```
**git push origin master**
```

That‚Äôs it! üôÇ
