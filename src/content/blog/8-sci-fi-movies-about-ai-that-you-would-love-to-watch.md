As a software developer or any working professional in general, you always need some time off to unwind yourself during the weekend or on a holiday whenever you get the chance.

You spend hours browsing and scrolling through Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, and other video streaming platforms to find the perfect film that will pique your interest, make you laugh, thrill you, excite you, and scare you.

Now, AI has been disrupting every industry that we can think of. And yes, the sheer imagination of AI had disrupted the movies and TV series _before it came to reality_ in many aspects.

Here are the movies that are based on artificial intelligence that you would love to see.

## **2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)**

I might be late to the party among my friends who have watched this film and praised it as one of the best science fiction movies that influenced directors like Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg. They are absolutely right.

I watched this film to kill my boredom during the lockdown of 2020, and I had a lot of questions about how director Stanley Kubrick thought and shot the film in 1968. The film is known for its groundbreaking visual effects (to date), philosophical themes, and minimal use of dialogue. This is a masterpiece that you need to watch and experience.

Without telling, you anything about the story, I can say that the film explores themes of _evolution_, _technology_, _artificial intelligence_, and the _nature of human existence_.

## **The Matrix (1999)**

Another masterpiece of the 1990s, where the theme was incredibly ahead of its time. The film is set in a dystopian world where reality is actually a simulated construct called the Matrix, created by intelligent machines to subdue and control humanity.

The film has two sequels (ignoring the third one), and those were equally good.

The film is celebrated for its innovative visual effects, including groundbreaking _bullet-time_ _sequences_, as well as its thought-provoking exploration of themes such as _reality, identity,_ and _freedom_.

## **A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)**

_A.I. Artificial Intelligence_ is a science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg, released in 2001. It is set in a future where climate change has caused widespread flooding and humanity has developed highly advanced robots called _mechas_, the story follows a young android named David who is programmed to love unconditionally.

The film explores themes of _love, identity_, and _the nature of consciousness_ as David embarks on a quest to become real in a world that rejects him.

## **WALL-E (2008)**

Probably one of the best Pixar movies ever made. This is the story of a lonely robot on a future Earth ravaged by pollution.

_WALL-E_, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, is the last robot left on Earth. He spends his days cleaning up the planet, one piece of rubbish at a time. But during the past 700 years, WALL-E has developed a personality, and he’s more than a little lonely.

Then he spots EVE (Elissa Knight), a sleek and shapely probe sent back to Earth on a scanning mission. Smitten, WALL-E embarks on his greatest adventure yet when he follows EVE across the galaxy.

The film explores _consumerism, environmental impact_, and _the coexistence of AI and humanity_ in a visually stunning space journey.

## **Her (2013)**

The film revolves around a lonely and introverted man who works as a writer, composing heartfelt letters for others. He is also undergoing a divorce from his childhood sweetheart, and he struggles with loneliness and isolation. His life changes when he buys an operating system with AI, designed to evolve and adapt to the user’s needs. He eventually falls in love with the AI.

_Her_ is considered a masterpiece as it tells the story of _loneliness_, _intimacy_, and _the human desire for connection_. Also, the relationship between a human and AI is becoming a reality as [we read news over and over again](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-ai-chatbot-widow-says).

## **Ex Machina (2015)**

When this film came out in 2015, I was incredibly excited to see it, and after watching the film, I wondered if this would be a reality by the 2030s. Well, guess what? It’s already there. Today, we have humanoid robots far more advanced than our ancestors could ever think of.

This film is praised for its thought-provoking exploration of themes such as _artificial intelligence_, _consciousness_, and _the nature of humanity_. This is another must-watch film that you will enjoy.

## **Blade Runner 2049 (2017)**

It is one of my favourite science fiction movies of all time, and it is a cinematic masterpiece, to say the least. It’s a sequel to the 1982 cult classic _Blade Runner._

The sequel is the story of a character named K, who is a Blade Runner. Blade runners are tasked with hunting down and “retiring” (read killing) _replicants,_ who are bioengineered humans created for various purposes.

The film explores themes of _memory, identity_, and _the nature of humanity_ against the backdrop of a visually stunning dystopian world. I can’t recommend you enough.

## **The Creator (2023)**

This is a story set in 2055, where an AI detonates a nuclear bomb that starts the war between humanity and AI. An ex-soldier is tasked with eliminating the key that can destroy “The Creator,” the mastermind behind the advanced AI. There’s a plot twist where the key to ending the war is with a child.

_The Creator_ is a fun science fiction film that you will love to see.
