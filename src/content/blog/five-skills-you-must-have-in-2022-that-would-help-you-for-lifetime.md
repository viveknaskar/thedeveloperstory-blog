Even though the outside world has been in chaos and whatnot, this year has been quite an eventful one, at least for me. A year back, I would have thought that I would be able to write anything and everything I wanted. Due to the pandemic, like everyone, I was also stuck at home. When you have all the time in the world, you want to spend it on something productive. For me, it was writing, among other things. I took it seriously this time, as I have tried many times but failed due to my consistency and lack of motivation. And also, due to the fact that I was going nuts doing nothing productive.

If you want to remain sane with everything going on, you need to develop some skills that will not only help you next year but also in the upcoming years to come.

Here are 7 skills that you must develop that will help you immensely in the upcoming years.

### Communication to Express Thoughts

I have been working in the software industry for at least 6 years now. I have met some of the best minds who have talent, skill, and determination with a “_never-give-up_” attitude. However, when there are meetings where they need to demonstrate their project or application to the client, they choke up (_not everyone though_). Words don’t come out. They know everything but don’t know how to express it. Yes, it can happen to the best of us.

Communication is no longer knowing a language. In fact, it never was in the first place. The true literal meaning of communication means expressing thoughts and presenting them in such a way that everyone understands.

Good communication skills further allow you to effectively make suggestions, ideas, and more to win projects. Well, it will definitely help you to win in life.

### Ability to Adapt to any Situation come what may

I know, it is not that easy as it reads. However, based on what I have learned in the current uncertain scenario, you must develop a flexible attitude towards new working environments that can secure your employment or any situation for that matter.

A lot of businesses have suffered and a lot of people have been asked to leave. People have started venturing into new avenues, trying out new things and learning new skills. In particular, switching to digital platforms to accomplish regular tasks is a work environment that may be a potential obstacle for many.

By staying open to emerging realities, you can maintain your productivity and performance for sure.

### Quick Learning is the Key

The world is changing faster than we can comprehend. The technology we have today would have been unfathomable to us 20 years ago.

For instance, Apollo 11, the spacecraft that landed humans on the moon for the first time on July 16, 1969. [_The navigation computer aboard Apollo 11 had a RAM capacity of 2,768 bits._](https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/would-your-phone-be-powerful-enough-to-get-you-to-the-moon-like-apollo-did-119070200272_1.html) _Even the most basic smartphones now have 4GB of RAM. This equates to 34,359,738,368 bits. This is more than a million times the memory of the Apollo computer._ 

The point I am trying to make is that technology is advancing so fast and we are just catching up with it. It is important that you learn new skills quickly. Slow learners at work are getting replaced, especially if they fail to catch up quickly with technological changes.

You need to embrace a flexible attitude and be open to new ideas that you should develop to stand out in your organization and in the job market.

### Teamwork creates Dreamwork

Collaboration is critical in today’s workforce. It ensures that your goals and objectives are in sync with those of your team members and the organisation as a whole. Working in a team also improves your thinking about completing a specific goal because you are offered so many different perspectives.

You can contribute to innovative problem-solving and successful judgments and strategies by honing your collaboration abilities. Not only will this assist to unify the workforce, but it will also enhance your earning potential.

### Critical Thinking Ability for tackling Problems

It is exceedingly tough to dodge problems that are heading your way in a chaotic environment. If the market crashes tomorrow, there will be job losses and financial crises. As a result, being able to access problematic situations and come up with the best available solutions is critical.

Critical thinkers, as opposed to impulsive decision-makers, may examine several perspectives on any complicated issue. It has a significant impact on the management’s and your own decision-making.

Everything around us is evolving rapidly. It is high time that we evolve ourselves by learning these skills to embrace the upcoming challenges we are going to face in life.
