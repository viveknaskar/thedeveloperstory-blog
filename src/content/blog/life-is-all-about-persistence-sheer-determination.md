Throughout my life, I have always dreamed of becoming financially independent so much so that I don’t have to rely on my parents or anyone for that matter. I have a weird confession to make. No matter how hard my family has been down with problems, setbacks and tragedies, I have always stayed calm because one thing I learned in life that when a problem comes no one would come forward to pull you up. Yes, there have been some friends who have always helped me and I am eternally grateful to them. However, we as a family never got any help, especially from our relatives. And we always were prepared for that.

We all grew up (_here in India_) watching the fictitious sugar-coated [_Bollywood_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood) movies (_Hindi Movie Industry_) where the families are always tied together and have an unlimited source of positivity emitting just like the Green Lantern [power ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ring_%28DC_Comics%29). In reality, the world is harsher than one can even anticipate. No matter what, you can never be prepared for the surprises life has to offer. And when that hits, all we can do is to pick ourselves, learn from the setbacks and move on to the next venture.

In life, it is mandatory to have belief in yourself. If you have belief, then only you can move forward. There are no shortcuts, to be honest. You must be persistent in achieving your goals. You must be determined to go beyond what is expected from you. It is extremely important for you to never deviate from your goals.

Just keep calm and trust in the words of Shah Rukh Khan,

> _“Kehte hain agar kisi cheez ko dil se chaho … to puri kainaat usse tumse milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai.”_

which translates to,

> _“It is saying that if you really desire something from the heart … then the whole universe will work towards getting you that.”_

All we have to do is strive for achieving our goals and fulfilling our dreams. After all, if we don’t work on them, then who else will?
