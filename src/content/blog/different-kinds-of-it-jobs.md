According to [Mike Jackson](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-06-coder-programmer-or-software-developer-spot-difference), a coder is,

> “Anyone who can write some code that compiles and runs, which will do something they want when it’s given the right inputs.”

A programmer does the same thing with logic in a clean and sleek methodology which Tom Fordham puts in words,

> “Programming is creating the logic, coding is translating that logic into code. Many students come into class able to code, but almost none come in able to program-that is, create the logic.”
