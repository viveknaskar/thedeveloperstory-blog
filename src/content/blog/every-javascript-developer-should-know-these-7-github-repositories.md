If you are a new developer, chances are that you must have started your development journey with JavaScript as your programming language using coding boot camps like [_freeCodeCamp_](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) or from any popular YouTube channel such as [_Traversy Media_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) or [_Net Ninja_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg). On the other hand, if you have been programming for a while, then you must have started with any of the C-family programming languages, but then you must have also used JavaScript (at least once) in your project.

JavaScript is known as the “language of the web” since its popularity has soared since the Node.js release. The “JavaScript everywhere” paradigm integrates all web application development around JavaScript. This is for both server-side and client-side development.

Recently, when I was working on some requirements where I needed to use JavaScript, I found some incredible GitHub repositories that are interesting and useful. As a result, I’ve compiled a list of repositories that will help you learn and improve as a JavaScript developer.

### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

![JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://thedeveloperstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-1024x625.png)

_Repo Link:_[**_https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms_**](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)  
_Stars:_ **_115k  
_**_Forks:_ **_19k_**

Oleksii Trekhleb, a Senior Software Engineer at Uber, has created this repository. He also maintains it. This was the first JS repo that I have starred. It provides examples of common algorithms and data structures in JS. It has a README file for each algorithm and data structure, translated into many languages. This README file has plenty of explanations and resources.

### Clean Code JavaScript

![clean-code-javascript](https://thedeveloperstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Clean-Code-JavaScript-1024x629.png)

_Repo Link:_[**_https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript_**](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)  
_Stars:_ **_54.6k  
_**_Forks:_ **_6.9k_**

Robert C. Martin’s book, [_Clean Code_](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) is the source for software engineering principles, is stored in the repo. Well, not every principle described here must be followed; there is no compulsion, and even fewer will be accepted. These are guidelines, but they are ones that the book’s writers have formalized through many years of combined experience.

### Awesome JavaScript

Wes Bos, a Full-Stack Developer, created this repo for his popular course ‘_JavaScript30_’. In this course, he created 30 JavaScript challenges for 30 days. This repo contains all the code he does for the challenges. The best part is that any developer can access the course for free in [_JavaScript30_](https://javascript30.com/).

### The Algorithms — JavaScript

For many years, several projects and programming languages or frameworks are learned from GitHub. I hope you find these repositories useful and make use of them to grow as a JavaScript developer.

I had a lot of fun making the list, and I am sure you’ve stumbled upon some more amazing repositories.

Happy Learning! Happy Coding!
