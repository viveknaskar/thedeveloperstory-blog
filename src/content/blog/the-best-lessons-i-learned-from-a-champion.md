Life doesn’t happen to you, it happens for you. I found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Nothing. We often take life for granted. We don’t even feel to do something until someone pushes us. We often procrastinate because we are afraid of failing at the tasks that we need to complete.

When I was in college, I was told by my parents, teachers, friends and relatives that Life becomes easy, once you start getting paychecks and you will be able to live happily but to be honest, I never understood that concept. You see, I just don’t want to work to earn paychecks and pretend to be happy. I want to work on something which I truly love and even if I fail, I will fail on doing something which I truly love. I figured at least this way I will know where I went wrong.

I have also learnt that without consistency, you will never finish what you have started. Hence, we all must do things we feel passionate about. Take chances. Don’t be afraid to fail. And don’t be afraid to fail big. Don’t be afraid to dream big. But yes, dreams without goals are just dreams. Thomas Alva Edison conducted over 1000 failed experiments when he was trying to invent the electric bulb. Every failed experiment is one step closer to success, you just got to take that risk.

Just remember that you will fail at some point in life. You can’t win always. Failures are inevitable. Failures will make you grounded and we must embrace it and learn from it. When I passed out of my college, I didn’t get a great job, the pay was less, but most importantly I didn’t love the work I was doing. Initially, I got comfortable because, for the first time in my life, I was earning on my own. The sense of freedom I got at that time cannot be explained in words. But I realized soon enough that I was just wasting my time, not doing what I dreamt of since my childhood. I started looking for jobs in an area I didn’t have experience but I always wanted to work. I failed numerous times. It was tough. But I didn’t quit. Finally, when you get what you want, you feel accomplished.

To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did. Because when you grow old, you don’t want to get angry, upset and disappointed with yourself for the things you never had the guts to do. Taking risk is not just about going for a job, or making a career change but it is also about knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Work on your skills and achieve what you want to achieve. Give your blood, sweat and tears to achieve your goals. Learn from your mistakes if you fail and cherish the victory with your whole heart.
