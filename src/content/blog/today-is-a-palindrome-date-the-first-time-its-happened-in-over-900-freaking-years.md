I am not sure if you’ve realized this yet, but today is 02/02/2020. if you are still wondering what is so funny about these numbers, well, it’s the perfect palindrome- it’s the same when read forwards and backwards.

And that’s not just in the MM/DD/YYYY format we use. Even the British format of DD/MM/YYYY, 2nd February, 2020 still reads the same.

**Even, at 2 A.M in the night, it read 02:02:20 on 02/02/2020**

That is cool but why is that special you ask? Well, this will occur only once this century.

You’ll actually be surprised how rare these dates are and the last palindrome date came 909 years ago on 11/11/1111. Only Count Dracula has seen this date in his lifetime (I believe he exists).

And the next will come in 101 years on 12/12/2121. following which, there isn’t another one until 03/03/3030.

So remember this day. It will be pretty difficult to forget, actually. It’s quite unique, so do something special today to make it memorable. Make a memory as you won’t get another date line this one in your lifetime.
