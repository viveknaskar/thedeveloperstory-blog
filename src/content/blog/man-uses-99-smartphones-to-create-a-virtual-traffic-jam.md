**Simon Weckert**, a Berlin-based artist, tricked the app into thinking that a completely empty street is congested. What he did was nothing short of brilliance as filled a hand driven wagon with 99 smartphones and opened Maps navigation on all of them.

In this case too, 99 smartphones piled up after another in a small street painted the street look congested.
