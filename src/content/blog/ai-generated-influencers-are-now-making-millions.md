Thereâ€™s no denying now that AI has disrupted every industry you can think of, whether itâ€™s factory workers, artists, writers, programmers, or now creators.

Artificial Intelligence has been the talking point of every company in the industry, and any public company that is working on AI in any capacity has seen its shares soaring through the roof.

As you know, social media influencers make tonnes of money by influencing the public to buy or invest in a product.

As a matter of fact, Gymshark, a British fitness apparel and accessories manufacturer, [has been valued at over $1.45 billion. The company relies on partnerships with influencers on TikTok and Instagram](https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2023/04/05/from-bodybuilder-to-billionaire-how-gymshark-founder-ben-francis-built-a-sportswear-unicorn/?sh=64c90d872ab0).

A couple of months ago, there was news that a social media influencer who created a digital persona of herself to be a [â€˜virtual girlfriendâ€™ was earning $72,000 per week](https://thedeveloperstory.com/2023/05/21/an-ai-girlfriend-makes-72k-in-1-week/).

Well, this time the news is the same with just one exception: it involves AI and social media influencers _without the human aspect_.

Meet [Lil Miquela](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/), the AI-generated Social Media influencer who is projected to make over $10 million this year. Sheâ€™s worked with companies like Chanel, Prada, and Samsung, and even modelled next to supermodel Bella Hadid for Calvin Klein.ðŸ‘‡.

In fact, Miquela was also named [one of Time Magazineâ€™s top 25 most influential people](https://time.com/5324130/most-influential-internet/) on the internet in 2018.

As of this writing, Miquela has 3.6 million followers on TikTok and another 2.7 million on Instagram. She charges more than $10,000 per Instagram post.

Miquela was created by the American AI company [Brud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/brudinc/about/). These social media influencers look incredibly human, and most people donâ€™t even realize that they are generated by AI.

This is not it. There is a bandwagon of these AI-generated social media influencers who have millions of followers: [Imma](https://www.instagram.com/imma.gram/), [Shudu,](https://www.instagram.com/shudu.gram/) and [Milla Sofia](https://www.instagram.com/millasofiafin/).

Companies are looking to develop in-house virtual influencers with multiple million followers to promote their products in the future for big-money collaboration deals.

The virtual influencer industry is currently valued at more than $3 billion.

This reminded me of Ana de Armasâ€™ character Joi, who was a holographic AI from the movie [Blade Runner 2049,](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/) where she played the girlfriend of the lead character.
