When I read the message about returning to the office, honestly, I was not very excited for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons was that I had to leave my setup of the desk and gaming chair, which I bought and did myself over a period of 2 months.

That was my den. My _mancave_. My zone.

Two months later, here I am sitting on the bed, writing this without my chair, in another city, about 1400 miles away from home, still unpacking my things while living a completely chaotic life.

Since last week, I have been going to the office. It definitely feels different. Not every employee of the company has joined as they continue to work remotely. Also, different projects have their own schedule of working days from the office. For my team, it is on Thursdays and Fridays, while the other days, it is work from home.

I remember when the remote work trend was initially forced on us due to the pandemic. Now, remote work has become the new normal as things have settled down and new habits have formed.

Although I love my office space and work and interact with my team in person, I _kinda_ feel alienated sometimes when they don’t come to the office, and of course, this is expected.

Unlike many industries where remote work doesn’t work well, the software development industry or the technology industry in general, can very well work remotely. In fact, most people working remotely have more time to work on their hobbies and spend time with their family and friends without compromising the quality of their work.

Technology is moving rapidly to change the way organizations engage with their employees to develop deeper engagement that benefits every stakeholder.

The two years of remote working have definitely given a new sense of flexibility that not only benefits the employees but also the employers. I am sure that there will be a time when the organizations and the employees agree that having everyone back in the office will not be an achievable goal.

Whatever the case, we won’t be going back to doing things the way we used to do them pre-pandemic.
