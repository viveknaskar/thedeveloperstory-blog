Last week, it was intense for one of the most popular social media platforms when Elon Musk decides to take a hostile takeover on Twitter. He got immense support from millions of fans as Musk has laid stressed the importance of free speech.

Twitter has actively banned or shadowbanned people on its platform which was supposed to be neutral until it is not. There was a podcast where the Twitter founder along with the global lead for legal, policy, and trust and safety at Twitter explained why they were banning people from the platform. The intention of such policies is to make the platform safer for everyone.

However, since there are millions of people with billions of tweets, the tweets are monitored and flagged by an algorithm that censors certain tweets based on some of the keywords. Well, this explanation is an over-simplification, but you know what I mean. Do watch/listen to the podcast when you get time.

Elon Musk has been one of the most followed celebrities, and he has been active ever since. Most of his tweets go viral.

Think of this: he is the most famous tech billionaire who trolls powerful people, companies, and organisations without having second thoughts via his tweets.

Somewhere down the line, as most of the critics say, Musk would have been banned from the platform. Realistically speaking, that seems unlikely given that he has over 85 million followers (_as of this writing_), but again, anything could happen, and if he was banned for some reason, his companies might suffer as well.

When Musk made the bid to buy Twitter for $44 billion, the news divided everyone. Some criticised, feared and outraged, while others celebrated and praised.

[When the deal was done](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61222470), Musk tweeted.

> I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means

Musk is one of the most influential figures in the history of the world. He has achieved impossible herculean milestones and built some of the most successful companies in a single lifetime. People trust him since they believe in him.

But then, there are people as well who don’t miss an opportunity to criticise Musk.

I just hope Musk makes Twitter transparent and safe for everyone. No individual or community should start receiving hate now that most tweets will not be censored.

That’s how free speech empowers everyone, right?
