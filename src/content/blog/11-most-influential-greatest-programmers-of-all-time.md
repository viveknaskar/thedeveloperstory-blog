The other day when I was trying to fix a bug in one of the applications I was working on, I was really frustrated with myself as the fix was really easy (_I missed some configuration but for some reason, the logs were not printing the error_). I wasted 25 minutes on it. After the code fix, I wondered what if I was sitting with one of the Greatest Programmers of all time (_hypothetically_), how much time would they have taken to find the root cause.

_1 minute?… 30 seconds?… 1 second?_

Programming is a skill. It’s an art for some. Some people just code for hours to relieve their stress. While others express their emotions by developing applications. Some create solutions to the most complex problems out there. The fact that ideas can be transitioned to reality via programming always fascinated me.

Here’s a list of the programmers (_in no particular order_) who pioneered the computing world and changed the way we access information today.

## Dennis Ritchie

Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist who created the **[C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))** along with his long-time colleague, Ken Thomson. He is credited for shaping and pioneering the digital era. Today, C programming is used in several software applications, embedded system development, operating systems, and has influenced most modern programming languages.

Richie also co-created the **UNIX operating system** along with Ken Thomson. For his work, in 1983 he received the **[Turing Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award)** from the ACM, the Hamming Medal in 1990 from the IEEE and in 1999 the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton. He was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.

## Tim Berners-Lee

Sir Timothy John “Tim” Berners-Lee also known as “TimBL,” is a British computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the **[World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)**. He is also credited for the implementation of the first **successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server** via the Internet in 1989.

Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen **[Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II)** in the **[2004 New Year Honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_New_Year_Honours)** “for services to the global development of the Internet” and was invested formally on 16 July 2004. He is also the holder of the Founders Chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer programmer who is the author of the popular [**Python programming language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) that is widely used today. In the Python community, Van Rossum is known as a “_Benevolent Dictator For Life_” (BDFL), meaning that he continues to oversee the Python development process, making decisions where necessary. Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.

From 2005 to December 2012, he worked at Google, where he spent half of his time developing the Python language. In January 2013, he started working for Dropbox. In October 2019, Van Rossum officially retired before coming out of retirement the following year to join Microsoft.

Van Rossum received several awards for his contributions to his work on Python. Some of them include the 2001 [Award for the Advancement of Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award_for_the_Advancement_of_Free_Software) from the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation) (FSF) at the 2002 [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) conference in Brussels, the honorary title of Dijkstra Fellow by CWI in 2019, etc.

Jon Skeet is a software engineer known for having the **highest reputation on the question-and-answer website** [**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/). Skeet joined Stack Overflow in September 2008 after reading about it in a blog post. Skeet became the highest reputation user on the site by December and reached one million in reputation in early 2018. His tenure has made him well-known on the site. He is a C# legend, won the Microsoft MVP award several times and is also a Java developer, he actually writes Java at Google. Skeet has written several books, notably [_C# in Depth_](https://www.manning.com/books/c-sharp-in-depth-fourth-edition), and is the author of the [_Noda Time C# API_](https://nodatime.org/). Skeet served on the board of directors of the .NET Foundation from 2019 to 2020.

Skeet has developed a cult following in the developer community because his answers have impacted approximately [333 million developers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet). He has actively contributed solutions to problems for C#, Java, and .Net framework.

Well, here are some of the most influential programmers of all time for me. Some other programmers deserve also honourable mention — [**Ada Lovelace**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace)**,** [**Bill Gates**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates)**,** [**Richard Stallman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)**,** [**Niklaus Wirth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth)**,** [**Satoshi Nakamoto**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto)**,** [**John Carmack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack), [**Jeff Dean**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean), [**Martin Odesrky**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky), [**Drew Houston**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Houston)**,** [**Mark Zuckerberg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg)**,** and [**Jack Dorsey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey). I am sure this list would be different for you.

I have also included Jon Skeet in the list even though he didn’t create a programming language or framework but he has helped to build the developer community of what we know today. Also, I have used his solution (_from StackOverflow_) to fix my configuration change mentioned at the beginning. No wonder **_[Skeet is known as the Chuck Norris of Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jon-skeet-the-chuck-norris-of-programming-ee5781c7e18a/)_**.
