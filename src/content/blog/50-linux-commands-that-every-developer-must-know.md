Linux is one of the most popular operating systems for servers, mobile phones, supercomputers, and personal machines. The fact that it is open-source and completely free is what makes it separate from other operating systems. What started as a hobby by a college student, soon became a revolution in the world of information technology.

You might already know this about the Android operating system, which is based on the Linux kernel, and [it is estimated that more than 130 million users in the United States alone use Android smartphones.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/232786/forecast-of-andrioid-users-in-the-us/) Linux is also utilized by 100 per cent of the world’s supercomputers, including NASA clusters.

This makes Linux one of the most important OS ever created. Over the past few years, I have been using Linux machines in my organization to deploy my applications in on-premises servers as well as on Cloud machines.

Well, to be honest, knowing a few of these useful Linux commands off the top of my head has made my life a lot simpler.
