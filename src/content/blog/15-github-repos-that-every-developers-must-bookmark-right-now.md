Over the last few years, GitHub has become more than a mere versioning-control system. It is a one-stop place where developers collaborate and contribute together that forms such a strong community and an enormous network among the developers and programmers. But finding useful repositories has been an uphill task for many.

As per Wikipedia, [_GitHub reports having over 40 million users and more than 190 million repositories,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) making it the largest host of source code in the world. The sheer mass also comes to the problem to find the most useful repositories available out there. Hence, I have put together a list of GitHub repositories that would help you to learn and grow as a software developer.

GitHub has been one of the best places to learn for many years now. I hope you find these repositories useful and utilize them to your advantage. I am sure you also might have come across some other incredible repositories.

Programming has been one of the most satisfying jobs for people who share their knowledge and contribute to the developer community. I am sure you would love to do that too (_if you haven’t already_ 😉).
