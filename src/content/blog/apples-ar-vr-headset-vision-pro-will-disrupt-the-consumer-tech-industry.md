No matter if you have a love-hate relationship with Apple, you can’t deny the fact that they have always been the pioneers in consumer technology.

I, too, have the same relationship with them. I just love their products but hate their pricing.

However, that doesn’t stop millions of Apple fanatics (_not me_) from changing their phones every year whenever Apple launches a new iPhone.

Well, a new gadget has been announced by Apple at the Worldwide Developer Conference — it’s their [Vision Pro XR headset](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/). A decade in the making, this device has quickly become a hot topic in the tech world.

One thing to note, though, is that Apple is calling the device a “spatial computer”_. I am not surprised, though._

I am pretty sure you might have watched their demo, as it is trending at the time of writing. But if you haven’t, do watch the video.

_Pretty fascinating, right?_

Apple, being the pro they are at marketing, would not admit it is a direct competitor to Meta’s VR headsets and their metaverse. Instead, they are calling it the _world of spatial computing_. I mean, that’s virtual and augmented reality.

While the headset’s specifications are already generating headlines, I came across a fascinating perspective from [Sterling Crispin](https://twitter.com/sterlingcrispin), an ex-designer on the project, on Twitter. He explains how AI models try to predict user behaviours, particularly emotional responses.

> “_There were a lot of tricks involved to make specific predictions possible, which the handful of patents I’m named on go into detail about. One of the coolest results involved predicting a user was going to click on something before they actually did. That was a ton of work and something I’m proud of. Your pupil reacts before you click, in part because you expect something will happen after you click. So you can create biofeedback with a user’s brain by monitoring their eye behaviour, and redesigning the UI in real time to create more of this anticipatory pupil response. It’s a crude brain computer interface via the eyes, but very cool._“

Apple announced that the device will _start at $3,499_ and launch early next year, starting in the US market, with more countries coming later in the year.

With its high price tag, the Vision Pro’s adoption rate and how it compares to the future [Meta Quest 3](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/meta-quest-3-coming-this-fall/) are important unexplored territories.

It will be interesting to see how these two tech giants compete as the VR/AR market evolves.
