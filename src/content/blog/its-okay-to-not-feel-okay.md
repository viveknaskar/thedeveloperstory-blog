Have you ever wondered what will happen if we stopped talking about our problems to someone else? Have you thought about what makes you unhappy? Have you ever felt ashamed of sharing an issue that is bothering you so much? Have you always thought that people are always happy and sorted and it is you who has the problem?

Well, guess what, you are not alone. We have seen this many times over and over again. Human beings are very fragile and we always have been like this. It is now that we are talking about. But why now and not earlier? It is like a silent disease that has destroyed the lives of millions but talking about it is still considered as a taboo in society.

## It’s Always Misunderstood

Mental Health issues are often misunderstood. In fact, Thomas Szasz, a Hungarian-American psychiatrist and psychoanalyst stated in his book, [The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Mental-Illness-Foundations-Personal/dp/0061771228?&linkCode=ll1&tag=thedevelope0e-20&linkId=19f263e25662f4da3be75214e236df9a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) stated that that mental illness is a metaphor for human problems in living and those mental illnesses are not “illnesses” in the sense that physical illnesses are; and that except for a few identifiable brain diseases, there are “neither biological or chemical tests nor biopsy or necropsy findings for verifying DSM diagnoses.” These kinds of statements really demotivate the people who are suffering from some kind of Mental Health issues.

## No One Knows How It Starts (Mostly)

Over the course of life, if you are experiencing a mental health issue, your thinking, mood and behaviour are drastically affected. Various factors contribute to mental health issues including, trauma, accident, breakup, family genes or even abuse. Sometimes it happens to individuals whose life, according to them, become monotonous. Some people even don’t know why they are depressed.

## It’s Okay To Ask For Help

It is in my opinion the most courageous thing to do. Reaching out if think you or someone you know needs help can make all the difference. Asking for help and opening up to other people in your life can help provide emotional support. Even getting professional help can heal a person immensely.

It’s important to know that recovery from most behavioural health problems is possible. If you or a loved one is suffering from an emotional health problem, please talk to someone. You can read more about it from [here](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/index.shtml).
