_Have you seen the film [Blade Runner 2049?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/)_ _If you have not, please do._ The film is set in a dystopian world in the year 2049, where the protagonist is in love with an AI.

Well, guess what? We don’t need to wait for 2049 for AI to disrupt how we date people.

At the [Bloomberg Technology](https://www.bloomberg.com/btv/series/bloomberg-technology-summit) Summit in San Francisco, [Whitney Wolfe Herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Wolfe_Herd), Bumble’s founder and executive chair, spoke about integrating AI into the dating app. She introduced the concept of “_AI-dating concierges_,” which could potentially chat with each other on behalf of users.

Wolfe Herd described a future where these AI tools could manage dating interactions by selecting potential matches, thereby simplifying the dating process.

The audience, including Bloomberg’s [Emily Chang](https://twitter.com/emilychangtv), reacted with laughter at the idea of chatbots managing romantic connections. Yet, the founder emphasized the efficiency of AI, suggesting it could filter through many potential matches to recommend the most suitable few.

"You could be talking to your AI dating concierge and share your insecurities… it could train you into a better way of thinking about yourself," [@Bumble](https://twitter.com/bumble?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)'s Whitney Wolfe Herd tells [@emilychangtv](https://twitter.com/emilychangtv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [#BloombergTech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BloombergTech?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/yJiDqgn60h](https://t.co/yJiDqgn60h)

Bumble is already exploring AI with features aimed at enhancing safety and improving connections, such as the [Private Detector](https://bumble.com/en-us/help/what-is-private-detector), [Deception Detector](https://bumble.com/en-us/help/what-is-private-detector), and For You.

Additionally, Bumble has introduced “_Opening Move_,” a feature to help women initiate conversations more easily by choosing from pre-written messages, which could potentially evolve into AI-generated content in the future.

Despite stepping down as CEO in November 2023, Wolfe Herd remains closely involved with Bumble’s developments. She mentioned that many women find the process of constantly generating unique responses tiring, and this feature was designed to alleviate some of that burden.

The idea behind Bumble’s AI innovations is to maintain the integrity and personal nature of dating while utilizing technology to streamline and secure the experience.

This comes as dating apps increasingly consider the potential of AI, with reports like a [Russian man claiming to have dated 5000 women using ChatGPT](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/chatgpt-helps-russian-man-match-with-over-5000-women-on-tinder-can-ai-help-us-find-love-13697392.html), indicating a growing trend in AI-assisted dating.

Think about it. It is a win-win situation for dating apps like Bumble, as people are leveraging AI to find dates anyway. This move would actually enhance the experience of Bumble users.

Recently, the AI robotics startup demonstrated that their humanoid robot called Figure 1, powered by ChatGPT, can do your household chores while having a full conversation with you simultaneously.

The days are not far when the events of Blade Runner 2049 might actually take place, where a human is dating an android. AI has been disrupting every industry in every possible way, and it was highly likely that it would disrupt the dating industry.
