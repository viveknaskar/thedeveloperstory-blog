In the year 1999, NVIDIA released its first Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) — [the GeForce 256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_256), after discovering that it could enable rendering engines to process 10 million polygons per second, paving the way for a 3D gaming revolution.

Well, fast-forward to 2023, GPU is now the most crucial piece of technology driving yet another technological renaissance — the AI revolution. Just look up at NVIDIA’s stocks now.

But you may ask, about AMD’s Ryzen?

While AMD has been displaying its gaming prowess, it has fallen a little behind in the AI relay race. 

AMD recently announced the acquisition of [Nod.ai](https://nod.ai/), a business specializing in optimizing AI applications for high-performance hardware, to gain a competitive advantage.

### NVIDIA Is Way Ahead Of Its Competitors

The reason NVIDIA has the edge over its competitors, ushering in the AI era, is not just due to their hardware capabilities.

NVIDIA is leading because they have equally invested in their software as well as their hardware. 

Most ML enthusiasts will know exactly what I am talking about — [_Compute Unified Device Architecture_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA), or _CUDA_. The CUDA platform is a software framework that was developed by NVIDIA that enables developers to build GPU-enabled applications on top of it. 

Early AI researchers began constructing neural networks on top of CUDA and, later, NVIDIA’s GPUs, which led to more widespread use of the software-hardware stack, and the rest, as we know, is history.

### AMD Catching Up

It seems like AMD is trying to go a similar route with this acquisition. 

AMD intends to base its growth strategy on an open source software ecosystem that simplifies client uptake through developer tools and models.

The acquisition is expected to dramatically improve AMD’s capacity to supply open software to AI customers, allowing them to simply install highly performant AI models customized for AMD hardware.

Only time will tell if it can catch up to NVIDIA.
