Microsoft’s Windows 11 is bringing centralized AI assistance called Copilot, making it the first PC platform to offer this feature.

Windows Copilot, like the Copilot sidebars we’ve seen in _Edge_, _Office apps_, and even _GitHub_, will be incorporated directly into Windows 11 and accessible from the taskbar across all apps and programmes.

Since Windows Copilot is built on the same foundations as Bing Chat, Microsoft is allowing developers to extend Bing or OpenAI’s ChatGPT plug-ins to this AI-powered assistant.

This opens up Windows Copilot to a slew of new features being developed for ChatGPT and Bing, as well as the possibility of future enhancements being automatically brought over to Copilot.

Microsoft will now begin publicly testing Copilot in June 2023, before handing it out to existing Windows 11 users.
