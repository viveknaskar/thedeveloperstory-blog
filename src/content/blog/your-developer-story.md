2.  You will know regarding various topics, ideas, and programming languages, and other technologies.

This blog is especially for the nerds and geeks like you who have decided to come to the site. Especially aimed for the programmers who are starting out or learning to code but are amazed (and confused), seeing the plethora of information available to them on the internet.

As Martin Fowler rightly said,

> “_Any Fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers can write code that humans can understand.”_

Are you ready with your developer story?
