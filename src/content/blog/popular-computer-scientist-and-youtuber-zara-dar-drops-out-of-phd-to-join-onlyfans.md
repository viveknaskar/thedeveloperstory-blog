We have all witnessed the technical shift ever since the internet was introduced to the public. The number of people who were sceptical of the technology was astonishing. 

I remember an interview of Bill Gates explaining what the internet is to a late-night show host, and somehow, the host, along with the audience present, was laughing their hearts out.

Fast-forward to the late 2000s; the internet had been widely accepted, and people were embracing it. There was a plethora of new apps emerging, enabling people to connect with others from different parts of the world. This also included modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Suddenly, the world didn’t seem so big any more.

To understand this technology, a branch of study was born: Computer Science and Engineering. Initially, it was barely scratching the surface, but over the years, the number of people interested in learning it has continually increased.

Fast-forward to 2024; we now have AI disrupting every field we know of. People are eager to learn and integrate this technology in every way possible. Naturally, there is great interest in foundational learning, but only a few YouTube creators have been teaching machine learning concepts, such as neural networks, for free. One such creator is Zara Dar.

Zara is a CS graduate student from Austin, Texas, who was pursuing a PhD. She gained significant popularity through her YouTube channel, where she shared educational videos, amassing 126K subscribers as of this writing.

However, in December 2024, Zara decided to drop out of her PhD program, citing her desire for greater autonomy and financial independence. In addition to her YouTube channel, she has been active on OnlyFans—a platform often associated with adult content but also used for niche and creative pursuits—which has garnered significant attention.

Zara is an exceptionally well-educated woman. She holds degrees in bioengineering and computer science and has successfully completed both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Despite her academic achievements and her progress toward a PhD, she felt that the traditional system was not working in her favour, leading her to take this unconventional path.

Platforms like YouTube and OnlyFans are empowering individuals to bypass traditional career routes, redefining what career success looks like in the digital age.

The only concern lies in the precedent it sets for upcoming creators, particularly those starting their careers and struggling to find footing in the increasingly competitive IT industry.
