In a couple of years, I will turn 30 and I am really grateful for all the experiences I have had all these years. I have always strived to be the best version of myself and for that, I have worked really hard to work upon myself physically, mentally and emotionally. I have tried and experimented with countless ideas and of course, several things went wrong but I have always learned from my mistakes. In fact, looking back at my life, I realized that all the important lessons are either from my mistakes or from my experiences.

Everyone has a different journey and that’s the way it should be. There is no blueprint for living a perfect life, trust me in this. If there ever was, we all would have been androids. However, living all these experiences have definitely taught me some important lessons that I wish I knew earlier. 

## Everything starts in your Mind

It is often said that the mind is the most powerful tool any human can ever possess. You can read all the self-help books and watch all the motivational videos, but it is you and only you who can have control over your mind. You can work to affect the world around you. By learning to master the mind, you will master your dreams, goals, and life. You will realize a power far greater than anything outside yourself.

> “The mind is a powerful force. It can enslave us or empower us. It can plunge us into the depths of misery or take us to the heights of ecstasy. Learn to use the power wisely.”

## You learn from your Failures

Think of a hypothetical life where you are completely perfect, you never commit a mistake, you are all sorted growing up, you know what you wanted to do. Just stop! It is impossible to be perfect, to be always right, to always be successful and if you ask me it is just plain dull. 

Well, the measure of success and failure is actually defined by you. Suppose, you started a business and you fail, it is natural to see that failure as a negative. After all, you started the business and it was not successful. Failures always expose your grey areas. However, you should use this failure as an opportunity to learn what went wrong. A will to learn and grow will inevitably lead to success.

## Time is more precious than Money

I have postponed so many things in my teenage years thinking that we all have an ample amount of time. I didn’t even realize that when you age, you are burdened with so many responsibilities. Our time is finite, yet most of us live contradictory to that.

We waste years doing the things we hate, stay with people we’re not entirely happy to be with and tolerate situations that don’t make us feel complete and fulfilled. We must understand that time is extremely precious and priceless which once lost cannot be recalled. You can have all the money in the world but if you don’t have time, it is no use, you won’t be able to spend it. 

Reflect on what you spend your time doing and make the necessary changes to realize the life of your dreams. After all, your time is precious and limited.

## Always live in the Present 

Since childhood, I have been taught to always work hard for a better future. Yes, I completely agree to put everything in sharpening your skill to achieve greatness in your respective fields. Yes, I also believe in planning for the future but a better tomorrow can have a better today as well. There is no point in making a better future that is built on today being worse.

The ability to quietly be with yourself and be aware of what is occurring around you is a skill you have to develop. It will improve the quality of your mind. Trust me on this, living in the present is an extremely powerful experience full of benefits and happiness that I always thought that I will find in the future.

I just wanted to finish this with small poetry, which I penned down in my journal when I was feeling low the other day.

_Life is plain and simple,   
we make it complicated_. 

_But again,   
we always have the choice  
to right our wrongs,  
we always have the choice  
to rise from fall._

_Life is all about experiences,  
lessons and fulfilment,  
and never about self-doubt,  
and resentment._

_Life is always about happiness,  
and joy,  
don’t let anyone belittle  
and destroy._
