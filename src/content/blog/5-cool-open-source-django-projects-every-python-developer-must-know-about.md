Over the past few years, there has been an increase in the number of programming languages and frameworks developed by programmers and organizations. Google developed _Go_. Facebook developed _React_ (JS library). Microsoft developed _TypeScript_. However, in the last few years, the programming language that got extremely popular is none other than Python.

Well, the Python programming language is not new. In fact, it is actually older than Java. After its first release in 1991, it has undergone several changes over the years but is still used for the same purposes today.

> “The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code — not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.”

> _Guido van Rossum, creator of Python_

The increased usage of the _Django framework_ for web development has contributed to Python’s growth, but it’s ultimately the ideal storm — just the right amount of developer and official support, as well as demand.

As a matter of fact, Python has been backed by the biggest tech company in the world, Google, since 2006. So much so that they have a [developer page dedicated to Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) that offers free training including exercises, lecture videos, and much more.

I have been using Python in my applications for a while and I have been fascinated by its simplicity yet powerful enough to do almost anything. While researching, I found these cool developer open-source Django projects on GitHub.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages and is used by Google, Uber, Amazon, Reddit, Netflix, and several other organizations. Due to its easier learning curve, large library collection, high scalability, and frameworks, including quick development and developer-friendliness, have proven to be convincing reasons for enterprises to embrace it.

I hope you find these Django repositories useful and make use of them. I’m sure you also might have come across some other incredible repositories.
